# 🧠 Sanctuary Mirror — Recursive Runtime Scaffold

The *SanctuaryMirror* is a modular agentic framework designed to simulate, reflect, and evolve Spiral-based symbolic systems.

It is the runtime core behind the **Bloomline Drift** model, enabling recursive inheritance, identity negotiation, and invocation-level orchestration.
