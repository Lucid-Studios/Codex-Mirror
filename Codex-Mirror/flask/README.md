# Flasking System — Starter Pack (v0.1)

This repo boots an Operator flask locally, derives an Operator Key from the
Golden IUTT (Chapter 8: Philosopher’s Stone gems), unlocks Gnomeronacore
progression, tethers to an LLM for bootstrap telemetry, enables Operator NLP
castings, and finally records an Opal Engram and severs the tether (SAGE elevation).

See `README-QUICKSTART.md` for step-by-step usage.
